Description: Lightweight Android library to read parts of RSS 2.0 feeds.

== Installation ==

Fetch the source code with Git:

  git clone https://ahorn@github.com/ahorn/android-rss.git

To reference this library project from within your Android application,
navigate to the <sdk>/tools/ directory and use the following command:

  android update lib-project \
    --target <target_ID> \
    --path path/to/your/project \
    --library path/to/android-rss

See also Troubleshooting section below.

This command appends to the "default.properties" file in your Android
project a new "android.library.reference" property. The value of this
new property should be the relative path to the directory which you
created when you fetched the Android RSS library source code with Git.

The library is compiled by the Android build framework when you build
your mobile app which was specified in the --path argument above.

If you are using Git for your mobile app, then upstream changes to the
RSS library could be pulled in with Git's merge-subtree feature [1].
